      <span class="name">MICHAEL CAPOBIANCO</span> is a junior studying Journalism and International Studies at Northwestern University. On campus, he is heavily involved with a few of Medill's sports publications, such as WNUR Sports and NNN Sports. Additionally, Michael has independently directed and produced two documentaries over the past two summers through the Northwestern Office of Undergraduate Research's Summer Undergraduate Research Grant program. The first, filmed in the summer of 2024, takes place in the mountains of rural central Italy and tells the story of revitalization and repopulation efforts in small villages. Last summer, Michael produced a documentary about two former professional basketball players living on Long Island and explored what the game means in a post-professional setting. Michael will be an Editorial and Research intern at NBC Sports this upcoming summer, and hopes to pursue sports feature production post-graduation.</p>

    <p> <span class="docname">The Gift of the Game</span> tells the story of two former professional basketball players that now hoop at the semi-pro and street level. The doc explores a side of the game that doesn't often get explored, and touches on what basketball can provide at a post-professional point in their careers: from a competitive outlet, money, a legacy, and lessons that translate to other parts of their lives and the dreams they still have in other places.</p>

     <p> <span class="docname">Visions for Abruzzo's Rural Towns</span> is the first documentary I directed and produced in the summer of 2024. It tells the story of three villages in the central Italian region of Abruzzo and their revitalization and repopulation efforts. I spent a month on the ground interviewing community leaders, attending music and religious festivals, and traveling around the area to film.</p>
