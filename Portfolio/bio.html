      <span class="name">MICHAEL CAPOBIANCO</span> is a junior studying Journalism and International Studies at Northwestern University. On campus, he is heavily involved with a few of Medill's sports publications, such as WNUR Sports and NNN Sports. Additionally, Michael has independently directed and produced two documentaries over the past two summers through the Northwestern Office of Undergraduate Research's Summer Undergraduate Research Grant program. The first, filmed in the summer of 2024, takes place in the mountains of rural central Italy and tells the story of revitalization and repopulation efforts in small villages. Last summer, Michael produced a documentary about two former professional basketball players living on Long Island and explored what the game means in a post-professional setting. Michael will be an Editorial and Research intern at NBC Sports this upcoming summer, and hopes to pursue sports feature production post-graduation.</p>
