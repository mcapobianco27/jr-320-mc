    <p> The Milan Cortina games mark the fourth time Italy has hosted the Olympics. Two decades ago, Turin held that honor, and 70 years ago in 1956, the Games were hosted in Cortina D'Ampezzo. For the next few weeks, the sporting world will be watching the events unfold in Northern Italy once again. </p>
