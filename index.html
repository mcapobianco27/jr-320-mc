    <p> Gray skies aren't the only gloomy thing in Evanston right now. Northwestern men's basketball - a team which, over the past three years, has rebuilt its culture and identity - finds itself dead-last in the Big Ten this season. Northwestern's two latest defeats of their five-game losing streak came at the hands of no. 13 Illinois and no. 8 Nebraska, both home at Welsh-Ryan Arena. The visiting squads were never going to be easy task for a Wildcats team with significantly less high-level recruits, but both losses were categorized by a flaw that has haunted the team all season: second-half collapses.
    </p>

    <p>On Saturday afternoon against Nebraska, the 'Cats trailed the Cornhuskers by just five points at the half. Senior forward Nick Martinelli has excelled this season, averaging 23.7 points per game, a mark which puts him at second in the nation. However, the supporting cast has failed to provide consistent minutes for head coach Chris Collins, who finds himself struggling night in and night out to find rotations that can withstand second-half pressure. The 'Cats were outscored by 14 points in the second half against Nebraska, whose guards relentlessly attacked a Northwestern defense which has been sub-par all season. Northwestern lost 77-58 in a game that never felt close after half-time.</p>

    <p>While Northwestern lacks some of the playmaking and scoring that it has had in past years, defense has been the squad's Achilles heel. <a href="https://kenpom.com/">Kenpom</a> ranks Northwestern's defense as 110th in the country (by defensive rating), a mark far too low to compete in a loaded Big Ten conference. </p>

    <p>Northwestern finds itself towards the bottom of the Big Ten in a number of statistics.

     <ul id="stats">
         <li> 3-pt fg%: 31.5 (2nd-worst)</li>
         <li> Points per game: 77.3 (6th-worst)</li>
         <li> Steals: 5.6 (5th-worst) </li>
        <li> Fouls: 17.9 (5th-worst) </li>
     </ul>

    <p> Northwestern will travel to the West Coast this week to face off against USC and UCLA, desperately searching for their first conference win of the season. Currently, the 'Cats sit dead in the water with little to no postseason hopes. But as the saying goes, all it takes is one. </p>
